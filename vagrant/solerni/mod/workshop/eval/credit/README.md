Participation credit
====================

Simple grading evaluation method for Moodle Workshop module that gives credit
to peer-reviewers just for their participation in the activity without
comparing their assessment with the others.

There are three modes of how grades for assessment are calculated by this method.

* All or nothing - The reviewer must assess all allocated submissions in order
  to obtain the maximum grade; otherwise they receive a grade of zero.
* Proportional - The grade obtained is proportional to the number of
  assessments. If all allocated submissions are assessed, the reviewer will
  obtain the maximum grade; if half of the allocated submissions are assessed,
  the reviewer will obtain 50% of the maximum grade.
* At least one - The reviewer must assess at least one allocated submission in
  order to obtain the maximum grade.
