                    <p>The
                    Service is available from the website (http://www.solerni.org/) which

                    features of the service are available without registration but to
                    fully use the Service, and its advanced features in particular, the

                    wishes to use the Service for their own purposes and solely for
                    personal, non-commercial use.</p>

                    <p><strong>ARTICLE 1 - DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
                    <p>In
                    these general terms and conditions of use, unless otherwise
                    specified, the following terms have the meaning given to them in this
                    article:</p>
                    <p>Account:
                    a space created by the User to become a Member and to use all the
                    Service functions. The following is saved by the Member in this
                    account: their personal information, and information on their
                    training.</p>
                    <p>Member:
                    any natural person who has registered with the Service, for personal
                    purposes, and who has an Account which gives them access to the
                    Service's advanced functions.</p>
                    <p>The
                    Member accesses their Account by using Credentials.</p>
                    <p>Credentials:
                    the user name and password chosen by the User when they create an
                    Account. These credentials are strictly personal and confidential.</p>
                    <p>Service:
                    all functions of the &quot;Solerni&quot; electronic communication
                    service.</p>
                    <p>User:
                    any natural person who accesses the Service, whether or not they are
                    a Member.</p>

                    <p><strong>ARTICLE 2 - PURPOSE</strong></p>
                    <p>The
                    purpose of these general terms and conditions of use is to define the
                    terms under which the Service is made available to Users and how
                    Users should use the Service.</p>

                    <p><strong>ARTICLE 3 - ACCESS TO THE SERVICE</strong></p>
                    <p>3.1 Technical prerequisites</p>
                    <p>The
                    use of the Service requires the User to have a compatible device,
                    access to the Internet and potential updates. As a result, the
                    possibility of the User being able to access the Service depends on
                    the performance of each of these elements.</p>
                    <p>The
                    User recognises and accepts that they must have all of the equipment
                    described above. In the same way, the User recognises and accepts
                    that possessing this equipment does not guarantee access to the
                    Service.</p>
                    <p>In
                    order to benefit from this Service, the User must have access to the
                    Internet from their device and they must verify that they hold an
                    offer to allow access and, if necessary, they must be aware of the
                    payment methods for use of the Service. Next cannot be held
                    responsible, under any circumstances, for any costs generated by use
                    of the Service and billed by the User mobile telephone operator.</p>

                    <p>3.2 Service Activation</p>
                    <p>Use
                    of the Service is proposed by Next for free.</p>
                    <p>To
                    fully use the Service, and in particular its advanced functions, the
                    User must register with the Service by creating an Account. To create
                    their Account, the User must fill in an online registration form by
                    completing the mandatory information.</p>
                    <p>Moreover,
                    to validate their registration, the Member must read and accept these
                    General Terms and Conditions of Use.</p>
                    <p>An
                    email confirmation will then be sent to the Member at the email
                    address indicated.</p>
                    <p>Once
                    registered, the Member can access their Account and MOOCs or any
                    other online collaboration system.</p>
                    <p>At
                    any time, the Member can log out from the Service (via the log out
                    button). When using the Service, the Member must enter their
                    Credentials to log in to the Service, or they can consult the Service
                    as a User.</p>
                    <p>If
                    the User has ticked the &quot;Remember Me&quot; box, a cookie is
                    placed in their browser so that they can be automatically identified
                    without having to re-enter their Credentials.</p>
