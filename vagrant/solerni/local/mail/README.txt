Local mail plugin for Moodle
============================

This plugin allows users to send messages to each other, using an
interface and features similar to webmail clients. Messages are tied
to courses, so users can only contact other participants in courses
the user is enrolled in. Reading/sending of messages is done through a
new item in the navigation block called "My Mail".
