moodle-local_analytics
==================

A local Moodle Module adding Site Analytics

The plugin features the following options:
- exclude tracking of admin users
- build full navigation tree for Piwik course category and activity tracking
- image based tracking in case javascript is disabled (for Piwik)
- advanced analytics for Google analytics (based on Bas Brands and Gavin Henricks work in 2013 http://www.somerandomthoughts.com/blog/2012/04/18/ireland-uk-moodlemoot-analytics-to-the-front/)

Install instructions:
1. Copy the analytics directory to the local directory of your Moodle instance
2. Visit the notifications page
3. Configure the plugin

Configuration:
The plugin currently supports 3 Analytics modes, Piwik, Google Universal Analytics and Google Legacy Analytics.

Piwik
- Set the Site ID
- Choose whether you want image fallback tracking
- Enter the URL to your Piwik install excluding http/https and trailing slashes
- Choose whether you want to track admins (not recommended)
- Choose whether you want to send Clean URLs (recommended):
	Piwik will aggregrate Page Titles and show a nice waterfall cascade of all sites, including categories and action types

Google Universal Analytics
- Plugin modifies the page speed sample to have 50% of your visitors samples for page speed instead of 1% making it much more useful
- Set your Google tracking ID
- Choose whether you want to track admins (not recommended)
- Choose whether you want to send Clean URLs (not recommended):
	Google analytics will no longer be able to use overlays and linking back to your Moodle site

Google Legacy Analytics (soon deprecated by Google)
- Plugin modifies the page speed sample to have 50% of your visitors samples for page speed instead of 1% making it much more useful
- Set your Google tracking ID
- Choose whether you want to track admins (not recommended)
- Choose whether you want to send Clean URLs (not recommended):
	Google analytics will no longer be able to use overlays and linking back to your Moodle site

Workings:
The plugin will inject tracking code for Analytics purposes into every page. 
If debugging is enabled the URL that is tracked will be displayed on the bottom of the page.
