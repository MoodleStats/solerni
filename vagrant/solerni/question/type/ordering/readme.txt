To INSTALL or UPDATE this plugin

       If you are installing from a zip file, unzip the zip file, to create a folder called "ordering"
       and upload or move this folder into the "question/type" folder on your Moodle 2.x site
       to create a new folder at "question/type/ordering" - not "question/type/ordering/ordering" :-)
