This script describes the steps to test the usage information display feature.
It is intended to cover only this single feature. As this feature displays usage statistics
for a forum a full independent test using a large 'real-world' data set is recommended to be carried out in
addition to this specific functional test.

NOTE: In this test case, the word 'forum' always refers to the OU ForumNG.

Initial setup
=============

This test case requires:

Student user (S1)
Student user (S2) for testing most rated posts
Student user (S3) for testing most rated posts
Editing Teacher (ET1) for testing most rated posts
Admin/Manager/Teacher user (Admin) - Must be able to create activities, have access all groups, create anonymous posts etc

Test course with multiple (2+) groups, user S1 must be a member of at least 1 group.
If testing with multiple (2+) groups, user S2 must be a member of a different group to user S1
If testing with multiple (2+) groups, user S3 must be a member of the same group as user S2
If testing with multiple (2+) groups, user ET1 must be a member of the same group as users S2 and S3

The test server must have debugging set to DEVELOPER level and to display
errors; during all parts of the test script, there should be no debugging warnings.
