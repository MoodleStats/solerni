Advantages of using the page module rather than the file module include the resource being more accessible (for example to users of mobile devices) and easier to update.

For large amounts of content, it\'s recommended that a book is used rather than a page.

A page may be used

* To present the terms and conditions of a course or a summary of the course syllabus
* To embed several videos or sound files together with some explanatory text';
