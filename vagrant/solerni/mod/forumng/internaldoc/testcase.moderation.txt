EML Email
=========
NOTE: Before starting this section, check that both users (U.S1, U.ET)
have email addresses set up that go to an email address that you can read.
The text 'allowemail' must be added to the image alt field of the user's profile.
When testing within the OU, note that developer servers will only send email
to OU (@open.ac.uk) addresses.

NOTE: This script uses the phrase 'trigger email sending' to indicate that you
should make sure the system sends out emails at that point. You can manually
trigger email sending by visiting the URL admin/cron.php in a browser when
logged in as admin. It will probably be useful to use multiple browsers for
this test (one to do the email sending, the other for everything else).

NOTE: Running cron.php also runs periodic tasks for all other modules, not
just ForumNG. Consequently, cron might be broken even if there is nothing wrong with ForumNG.
You may also use the URL local/cronadmin/selectivecron.php?module=forumng
which will only run over the forumng.

EML01 / U.ET [change]
   Trigger email sending [see above].
-  Verify that you receive a digest email copy of F.AMNE and F.AME.
   In the digest email, check the copy of 'Teacher UET anonymous moderator discussion 1',

   'Moderating Teacher, standard post' and 'Student 1 reply to teacher post'
