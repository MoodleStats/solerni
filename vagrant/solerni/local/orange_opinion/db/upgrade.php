 * Folder module upgrade code
 *
 * This file keeps track of upgrades to
 * the resource module
 *
 * Sometimes, changes between versions involve
 * alterations to database structures and other
 * major things that may break installations.
 *
 * The upgrade function in this file will attempt
 * to perform all the necessary actions to upgrade
 * your older installation to the current version.
 *
 * If there's something it cannot do itself, it
 * will tell you what you need to do.
 *
 * The commands in here will all be database-neutral,
 * using the methods of database_manager class
 *
 * Please do not forget to use upgrade_set_timeout()
 * before any action that may take longer time to finish.
