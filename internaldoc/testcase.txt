This file contains a sequence of test cases for most ForumNG features.

Each single section is independent so that tests can be completed without the
need to do all of them. The exception is the first section; you need to
complete the first section in order to have the forums in place that other
parts of the test require.

Each section has a unique (within this test case) three letter code and the
steps are numbered so that the location where a failure occurs can be reported.

Steps are shown in the following format:

XXX01 / U.S1 [change]
  Do something
  - Check something

The unique step number is followed by the user that you should be logged
in as for that step. If the user changes from the previous step, the word
[Change] will be noted.

Some steps don't have specific items to check. In that case, the check
'passes' if there are no errors or warnings while completing the task.

When told to create a discussion or reply, you may wish to use the code number
for that step inside the text of the discussion/reply. Occasionally, later
steps might refer to the reply UNR03 or whatever.


Initial setup
=============

Please set up a standard test course as follows.

Course short name
-----------------

FORUMTEST

Users and groups
----------------

U.S1 - student in group 1
U.S2 - student in group 2
U.ET - editing teacher, not in a group

The testcase.users.csv file can be used to create these users (for U.S1,
U S1 is the visible name; the login is us1; the password is appleA1;).

The test script also refers to the user 'admin' (the admin user).

User settings
-------------

Edit the profile for U.S1 so that the 'AJAX and JavaScript' option in their
profile is set to No.

Ensure that the same option is set to Yes for the other users.

Some parts of the forum have different behaviour in 'fancy' (AJAX/JavaScript)
mode, so we will test those parts with both U.S1 (No option) and U.S2
(Yes option).


Site settings
-------------

Under Developer/Debugging, ensure that debug level is set to 'Developer'
and to display messages.

Under Advanced features, ensure that activity completion is enabled.


CRE Creating ForumNG
====================

CRE01 / admin
  In any course week, from the add activity dropdown, choose 'ForumNG'. Leave
  all settings as default except name 'F.WC' (whole course) and group setting
  'No groups'. Save form and return to course.

CRE02 / admin
  Create another ForumNG with name F.SG and group setting 'Separate groups'.

CRE03 / admin
  Create one with name F.VG and group setting 'Visible groups'.

CRE04 / admin
  Create one with name F.SH, group setting 'no groups', 'Shared' ticked,
  and idnumber set to 'Frog'.
  NOTE:
  We will use the F.SH forum for most testing because there are lots of ways
  in which the system can go wrong when using shared forums.

DSM Discussion page miscellaneous junk
======================================

DSM01 / U.S1
  Go to F.WC (just for variety) and start a new discussion. Paste a reasonable
  chunk of text (say, this test step) into the post and use subject 'DSM01'.
  Post it. Reply to it with subject 'r1' and again paste a reasonable chunk of
  text. Reply to it a second time using subject 'r2' and pasted text. Finally,
  expand all posts and reply to r1, using subject r3 and again pasting the text.
  Expand all posts again.
  Scroll down so that r3 is at the top of the screen. Click on the 'Jump to:
  parent' link in r3.
  - Screen should jump to show r1 at top of screen.
  Scroll so that r2 is near top of screen. Click 'Jump to: Parent'.
  - Screen should jump to show DSM01 at top of screen.
  Click the 'Permalink' link in r3.
  - Page should reload, not expanded, with r3 at top.
    NOTE: This behaviour (not expanded) is not ideal, but it makes more sense
    when sharing the link with people using the normal JS version.
  Copy the current URL into clipboard.

DSM02 / U.S2 [change]
  Go to F.WC. Click 'Mark all read'. Then paste URL from clipboard and hit
  return.

DSM03 / U.S2
  Click Expand next to r2.
  - Post should appear.
  Click 'Jump to: Parent' next to r2.
  - Screen should scroll (fairly) smoothly to show DSM01 at top.
  Scroll down as far as possible while still able to see the 'Parent' link in
  r3. Click this link.

  using text r3. Reply to original discussion again using text r4. Reply to
  r4 using text r5.
  Delete your replies r3 and r1.
  - r3 should disappear entirely when deleted.
  - r1 should not disappear (because there is a reply to it); the author
    picture, author information, post date information, and content should
    all disappear and be replaced by a box showing only the information
    'Deleted by the author on (time).'

DEL06 / U.ET [change]
  Go into the discussion (DEL05).

  Note Delete popup is replaced with a physical screen when JS is disabled.

EML Email
=========

NOTE: This section specifies that you create new forums because that ensures
there is no old subscription information hanging around, reducing the
potential for confusion.

NOTE: Before starting this section, check that both users (U.S2, U.ET)
have email addresses set up that go to an email address that you can read.
When testing within the OU, note that developer servers will only send email
to OU (@open.ac.uk) addresses.

NOTE: This script uses the phrase 'trigger email sending' to indicate that you
should make sure the system sends out emails at that point. You can manually
trigger email sending on test servers by visiting the URL admin/cron.php in a browser
when logged in as admin. On acct/live servers the post emails
are sent at the start of every hour automatically.
It will probably be useful to use multiple browsers for
this test (one to do the email ending, the other for everything else).

NOTE: Running cron.php also runs periodic tasks for all other modules, not
just ForumNG. Consequently, cron might be broken even if there is nothing
wrong with ForumNG.

EML01 / U.ET [change]
  Create a new forum F.EWC set to 'no groups' mode. Go into the forum and
  click the Subscribe button to subscribe to the whole forum.
  - Verify that the text changes to indicate that you are subscribed to the
    forum and show your email address.
  - Verify 'Your email preferences (change):' and information on current email
    preferences are shown under the subscription text.
  Select 'change' link.
  - Verify you are taken to the user profile edit page for U.ET.
  Open the 'Preferences' section.
  Set 'Email format' drop-down to 'Pretty HTML format'
  Set 'Email digest type' to 'No digest (single email per forum post)'
  Select 'Update profile'
  Navigate back to forum F.EWC
  - Verify 'No digest (single email per forum post), Pretty HTML format' is shown
    in the subscription preferences information text.

EML02 / U.ET
  Ensure you are in forum F.EWC
  Start new discussion EML01. In the form, click the 'Mail soon' box.
  In that discussion, create a reply EML01-b; but in this reply, do not click
  the 'Mail soon' box.
  - Verify that no subscription information including mail preferences is shown at the
    bottom of the discussion.
  Trigger email sending [see above].
  - Verify that you receive email copy of EML01 but not EML01-b.
  Wait for the system editing timeout (5 mins). While waiting, go to your user profile and
  change the setting about email type from HTML format to text format.
  Then trigger email sending again.
  - Verify that you now receive email copy of EML01-b in text format.
  Change email type back to HTML format.

EML03 / U.ET
  Check the email copy of EML01.
  - Verify that it is in HTML format.
  - Verify that it contains whatever message you typed, along with
    course shortname, forum name, and at the bottom, an unsubscribe link.
  Check the email copy of EML01-b.
  - It should be similar but in plain text format.
  - Verify that it includes, at the bottom, the message that it was replying
    to (i.e. the text of the original discussion post).

EML04 / U.ET
  Go to F.EWC and click the 'View subscribers' link.
  - List of subscribers should be shown (containing only you).
  In one of the emails, click the unsubscribe link.

  Go back to F.EWC and use the button to subscribe again. View subscribers.
  - Now you're on the list again.
  Click the tickbox next to your name and click the unsubscribe button.
  - No subscribers again.
  Go back to F.EWC and click Subscribe then Unsubscribe; check the list.
  - Still no subscribers.

EML05 / U.ET
  Go to F.EWC forum home page.
  - Verify email preferences text is not shown under subscription option.
  Start a new discussion 'EML04-a' (mail soon). In that discussion,
  make a reply EML04-b (mail soon). Delete the reply.
  Start a new discussion EML04-c (mail soon). Delete it.
  Start a new discussion EML04-d (mail soon). Set it to not appear until the
  future.
  Subscribe to F.EWC again. Trigger email sending.
  - Check that you receive EML04-a but not any of the others.
    NOTE: It would be good to test EML04-d is actually emailed after the date
    passes, but I couldn't think of an easy way to test that without actually
    waiting for the next day; and for a full test (given the safety-net period),
    it would have to be about a week probably.

EML06 / U.ET
  Unsubscribe from F.EWC.
  Start a new discussion 'EML05-a' (mail soon).
  Start a second new discussion 'EML05-b' (mail soon).

   - Verify 'Your email preferences (change): No digest (single email per forum post),
     Pretty HTML format' is shown in the subscription preferences information text.
  - Trigger email sending.
  - Check that you receive EML05-b but not EML05-a.
  Return to F.EWC main page.
  - Verify that text by subscribe button shows you as subscribed to 'some
    discussions' and offers a 'subscribe all' / 'unsubscribe' choice.
  View subscriber list.
  - Check that it shows you with the note indicating that you are subscribed
    to 1 discussion, where previously it showed 'whole forum'.
  Return to F.EWC main page. Click unsubscribe.
  - Verify that it now says you aren't subscribed at all.
  Delete forum F.EWC.

EML07 / U.ET
  Create new forum F.ESG set to separate groups mode. Ensure you are in the
  'all participants' view, then click subscribe button.
  - It should say that you are subscribed to the forum.
  Change to group G1. Start new discussion EML06-a (mail soon).
