This file contains a sequence of test cases for the auto locking ForumNG feature.


Each section has a unique (within this test case) three letter code and the
steps are numbered so that the location where a failure occurs can be reported.

Steps are shown in the following format:

XXX01 / U.S1 [change]
  Do something
  - Check something

The unique step number is followed by the user that you should be logged
in as for that step. If the user changes from the previous step, the word
[Change] will be noted.

Some steps don't have specific items to check. In that case, the check
'passes' if there are no errors or warnings while completing the task.

When told to create a discussion or reply, you may wish to use the code number
for that step inside the text of the discussion/reply. Occasionally, later
steps might refer to the reply UNR03 or whatever.
