This file contains a sequence of test cases for the ForumNG Sticky feature.

Initial setup
=============

See testcase.txt for a description of the format of these tests.
Since this test deals only with the forum view page user interface, only these instructions
will be required.
Only one forum is required. Six discussions will need to be setup, as follows:

Discussion1 - a discussion containing one text post replies.
Discussion2 - a discussion containing two text post replies.
Discussion3 - a discussion containing three or more reply posts.
Discussion4 - a discussion containing four or more posts.
Discussion5 - a discussion containing five or more posts.
Discussion6 - a discussion containing six or more posts.

Some parts of the interface have different behaviour in 'fancy' (AJAX/JavaScript)
mode, so we will test those parts with first with Javascript disabled and then enabled in the browser
