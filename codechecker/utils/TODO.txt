Some ideas for new scripts:

* save  - copy db and data for site based on *current* instance to safe place
* load  - restore named db and data for site based on *current* instance from safe place
          option to pull in remote db backups e.g. t1.1.4, m2.2.8 (or closest db before site's version)
* push/pop - same as save/load but with a stack
* modconf - modify one or more params in the config only
* test - setup unit tests and run them
* adddata - add auto generated data of specific type to current install (based on config)
* upgrade - cliupgrade current site (with optional initial db to use instead of current using load)
